        <dt>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</dt>
        <dd>
          My long term goal is to become a full-stack developer. I am also
          passionate about exploring design and creative aspects of software
          development.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          My strengths: I am an agreeable person and I can work with people
          easily. I am resourceful, empathetic, and I stick to my commitments.
          My limitations: I can find myself going down rabbit holes and
          overthinking things. This can cause me to lose precious time.
          Technical skills are new to me so this currently makes me slow at
          doing all the tech things.

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Asking for help and accepting that help! I am more than happy to help
          others and give my time to them but I struggle to ask for help and for
          others' time.

        <dt>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
          work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
          industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
          building up and starting to get to you
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I will endeavour to have early nights so that I can wake up at a
          reasonable hour in order to work productively and safely. I have a
          timetable which I will stick to following; and this allows me to take
          breaks appropriately as well. I will also keep in touch with my
          facilitators and keep them posted along the way. If things are
          starting to build up for me, I will contact my facilitators for
          support. I will also have my support network involved.

        <dt>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </dt>
        <dd>
          If I am starting to feel like I am falling behind, I will get my
          support network involved and then escalate to my facilitators if
          needed. For technical support, I will seek help on discord before
          contacting my facilitators.

          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I expect to have semi-regular contact with my facilitators and for them to be responsive and supportive.

        <dt>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I have Tuesdays blocked out during foundations as I spend this time to reflect and be with whānau. I also have weekly appointments on Wednesdays that I have already planned to be moved to the evening during the bootcamp.
