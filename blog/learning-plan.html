        <dt>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</dt>
        <dd>
          I would still like to work towards becoming a full stack dev as a long
          term goal. I am hoping to use the skills I learn in this course to:

          <ol>
            <li>
              Firstly, improve the quality of my life with the financial
              stability and independence I will gain from entering the industry
              as a junior/grad dev.
            </li>
            <li>
              Empower others coming from low socio economic backgrounds and
              marginalised communities to enter, and become proactive in the
              industry to better the representation in development of technology
            </li>
            <li>
              Work on charitable projects outside of employment (such as an app
              for animal adoption services), in order to help uplift local
              communities.
            </li>
            <li>Keep learning because there is so much out there!</li>

          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          After re-evaluation from sprint 2, I think that my strengths around
          being agreeable, resourceful, empathetic, and dedicated are still
          valuable. Since Sprint 2, I have gotten to see other strengths I was
          not as aware of. I've been sick, my dog was injured, and a bunch of
          other unexpected personal challenges came up during foundations. I
          persevered through these and managed to complete all my work within
          the guided deadlines and I am really proud of myself for this.

          <p>
            After re-evaluation from sprint 2, I think my limitations also
            remain the same with being easily distractable, over-thinking, and
            not being super confident with my technical abilities. Core work in
            Foundations helped me discover the extent of the hindrance my
            negative self talk can have on my productivity and emotions. Now
            that I am more aware of this, I am going to be mindful of this
            tendency and work on self-compassion throughout bootcamp and in
            everyday life.

          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          My biggest non-technical challenge will most likely be overcoming my
          inner critic and self-judgements throughout Bootcamp. Another
          challenge for me will be making it on time for early morning starts as
          my concept of time is all over the place due to ADHD. I have asked my
          facilitator for linking me with a go-to person for Bootcamp so that I
          can get support with working through my negative self talk if needed.
          I have also talked with my Facilitator about getting out for fresh air
          to do some emotional regulation exercises at the Domain. I am looking
          forward to engaging in the yoga sessions as another method of
          self-compassion. I am going to work on waking up early in my revision
          week so that my body/sleep patterns are better adjusted for Bootcamp.
          I am ging to do this with writing up a timetable for revision week and
          setting alarms.

          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I would like to see myself develop more confidence in my abilities
          overall by the end of Bootcamp. This lack of confidence can make me
          very passive in teamwork as I don't think I have much to contribute.
          To work on this, I am going to do my best with voicing my ideas even
          if I am not sure about them.

        <dt>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</dt>
        <dd>
          I expect to have people I can go to for clarification on
          coding-related concepts and at times, this may mean that I need a one
          on one conversation that helps me gain a better understanding. Being
          able to have discussions on concepts is important for my learning, and
          it may require a bit of patience from the Bootcamp team from time to
          time. If I am having a hard mental health day, I hope that the
          classroom environment is a space where I can safely declare that
          instead of having to pretend/put a poker face on that takes up a lot
          of energy and results in less productivity. I expect to be able to
          give constructive feedback to the team without anyone getting
          defensive, angry, etc. I also expect to receive feedback constructively
          so that I can grow as a dev and as a person.

      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</dt>
        <dd>
          For starters, I expect myself to be there on time everyday! I expect
          myself to engage with people and the material in a respectful manner
          and to work on taking small break for emotional regulation if I start
          feeling overwhelmed or anxious. I will ask the team for support, and
          this will be much easier for me to do when I am there in person. I
          will also take my diary with me and check in with myself regularly so
          I am more aware of what is happening for me internally. I have my
          support networks outside of Bootcamp set up so I can contact them for
          emotional support as well. I hope to have check ins with my designated
          support person at Bootcamp and I am going to write a personalised
          well-being plan for myself to ensure that I take care of myself
          through the intensive learning.

          My long term goal is to become a full-stack developer. I am also
          passionate about exploring design and creative aspects of software
          development.

        </dt>
        <dd>
          My strengths: I am an agreeable person and I can work with people
          easily. I am resourceful, empathetic, and I stick to my commitments.
          My limitations: I can find myself going down rabbit holes and
          overthinking things. This can cause me to lose precious time.
          Technical skills are new to me so this currently makes me slow at
          doing all the tech things.

        <dd>
          Asking for help and accepting that help! I am more than happy to help
          others and give my time to them but I struggle to ask for help and for
          others' time.

        </dt>
        <dd>
          I will endeavour to have early nights so that I can wake up at a
          reasonable hour in order to work productively and safely. I have a
          timetable which I will stick to following; and this allows me to take
          breaks appropriately as well. I will also keep in touch with my
          facilitators and keep them posted along the way. If things are
          starting to build up for me, I will contact my facilitators for
          support. I will also have my support network involved.

          If I am starting to feel like I am falling behind, I will get my
          support network involved and then escalate to my facilitators if
          needed. For technical support, I will seek help on discord before
          contacting my facilitators.

          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are

        </dt>
        <dd>
          I have Tuesdays blocked out during foundations as I spend this time to
          reflect and be with whānau. I also have weekly appointments on
          Wednesdays that I have already planned to be moved to the evening
          during the bootcamp.
