          1. Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you were blocked on
          a simple problem. What was the problem?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I had to write code for this problem and I just didn't understand what
          I was doing wrong. I understood logically what I needed to do but I
          couldn't figure out the syntax and structure of how to actually write
          the solution.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</dt>
        <dd>
          I tried:
          <ol>
            <li>Read and understand the problem</li>
            <li>
              Look at the hints, tests, and info in handbook for guidance.
            </li>
            <li>Read recommended links for more clarification.</li>
            <li>
              Go back and read the problem again with all this new info and see
              if I can solve the problem at this stage.
            </li>
            <li>
              If I still don't quite understand, then I google for more specific
              resources and examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then I'd pseudocode to help break things down and brainstorm
              potential components of a solution.
            </li>
            <li>Practice rubber ducking.</li>
            <li>
              Look on discord to see if others are asking for help about the
              same problems.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>How did you feel throughout the process?</dt>
        <dd>
          I felt very frustrated  throughout the process because I understand the
          logic and wider concepts but I just don't know how to transform that
          into code that a computer will accept.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What did you learn?</dt>
        <dd>
          I learnt that frustrated  is going to be an ongoing part of my
          experience with learning how to code. I learnt console logging to see
          what my code is looking like and for trouble-shooting. I also learnt
          that I am a visual learner and attaching abstract concepts to images or
          stories really helps me learn.

          2. Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you elegantly solved
          a problem. What was the problem?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          After solving the problem I talked about earlier, I had to solve
          another problem that used this thing called the .filter method. I
          solved it much more easily after having a better grasp of syntax.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</dt>
        <dd>
          I looked at the hints, tests, and info in handbook for guidance. Then
          I read recommended links and googled for more clarification. I used
          the rubber duck method as well.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>How did you feel throughout the process?</dt>
        <dd>
          I felt unsure at first. As I problem-solved using the techniques
          above, I felt like things started to make a bit more sense.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What did you learn?</dt>
        <dd>
          That I am learning lots of things even though it may not feel like I
          am learning anything sometimes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
          problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Pseudocode: I am more comfortable using pseudocode and it really
              helped me break the problem and my approach down. I'm about a 8/10
              confident (10 being super confident).
            </li>
            <li>
              Trying something: I use this when I have exhausted most other
              avenues and think it feels like a stab in the dark to just try
              something. I'm about a 6/10 confident but its not my preference as
              a technique.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rubber ducky method: This was a really helpful tool surprisingly,
              and it pointed out to me what my learning gaps are as I talked out
              loud. I'm about an 8/10 confident with this technique.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reading error messages: The Replit exercises taught me to see the
              value of reading error messages and I feel more comfortable
              reading them now. I'm a 7/10 confident with this one and I want to
              make a habit of using this technique more often.
            </li>
            <li>
              Console.logging: I finally understood the purpose of console
              logging this week. I spent a chunk of my time this week gaining a
              clearer understanding about what console logging actually does and
              how it differs to calling or returning. I'm a 6.5/10 confident
              using this technique.
            </li>
            <li>
              Googling: This has been my go to technique from previous studies
              as well, so I'm pretty confident (9/10) with this technique.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asking your peers for help: I am about a 4/10 confident with
              asking my peers for help. I don't like to take up people's time
              and energy and I don't want to sound stupid and I know this is
              something on my end I need to keep working on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asking coaches for help: I am about a 4/10 confident with asking
              coaches for help for the same reason as above. I am going to work
              on this by asking my facilitator for a catch up and for help with
              technical stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improving your process with reflection: I have used reflection to
              improve other aspects of my life so this technique is already well
              integrated in my life. 9/10 for confidence levels for this one.
