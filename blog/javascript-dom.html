          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
          CSS.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The analogy of a b'day card resonated with me and I'd like to use this
          to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. HTML is
          like the writing and pictures you see on a bday card- it's the
          content. CSS allows you to style this content and make it more
          aesthetically appealing. For example; instead of writing on a plain
          card, you can have a colourful card that makes it more pleasant. CSS
          is responsible for making plain HTML look pretty and more interesting!
          Sometimes you get interactive b'day cards that play a 'Happy Birthday'
          song, to other cards have things pop out when you open them up- this
          is where Javascript comes in. Javascript is responsible for
          interactive features such as animation or audio.

          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life.

          Imagine you are driving a car. You drive when the traffic lights are
          green, slow down and stop if you can when they are orange, and stop at
          the lights when they are red. The traffic lights represent the concept
          of control flow and loops in JS. Control statements are used to
          control the flow of program (like the flow of traffic) based on the
          specified condition. If statements, If else statements, if else if
          statements, and switch statements are all types of JS control
          statements. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they
          may only be true or false. Lets start with an analogy of if
          statements:
          <p>
            If the lights are green, then it is safe for you to drive. The
            condition here is that the lights must turn green in order for the
            result of driving the car to occur. In JS, the structure for
            capturing this is:
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/if-statement.png" alt="If Statement" />

          <p>
            What happens if the lights are not green, and are orange instead?
            This is where if else statements come in:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/else-if-statement.png" alt="Else If Statement" />
          <p>
            So now we have a statement for green lights, a statement for orange
            lights, but nothing to tell drivers when to stop at the lights. This
            can cause issues in the flow of traffic systems. An if else is
            statement can be used to execute one block of statements from many
            depends upon the condition. For example:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/else-statement.png" alt="Else Statement" />
          <p>
            Now we have code that allows us to conditionally execute behaviours
            for each colour of the traffic light system. Imagine we had a white
            light and a purple light added to the traffic light system. It would
            be quite lengthy to add them onto our code and this is where switch
            statements can be useful. Switch statements are more concise to work
            with when you have several groups of statements:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/switch-statement.png" alt="Switch Statement" />

          <p>
            Imagine you have a bunch of fruits you need to need to sort through
            after a grocery shop. Each fruit type has a dedicated box and you
            need to place the fruit in its dedicated box. For example, bananas
            go in the banana box, apples in the apple box, and so on until you
            have sorted through all the fruits. This broadly captures the
            concept of a loop in JS. Loop control statements repeatedly execute
            a block of code in order to sort through items appropriately. Here
            is an example of a 'for' loop:
          </p>

          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          From the first section of this blog post we know that; HTML provides
          the structure and content, CSS allows you to style this content and
          make it more aesthetically appealing, and JS is responsible for
          interactive features such as animation or audio. The DOM stands for
          Document Object Model and it allows you to see how HTML, CSS, and JS
          are used to construct a document. The DOM provides means to interact
          with objects in an HTML document.

          <p>
            In order to better understand the DOM, let's break down what the
            image below demonstrates:
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/dom-tree.png" alt="DOM Tree" />

          <p>
            The web browser is an application software that allows access to
            websites. It retrieves information from other parts of the web and
            displays it on your device (Eg: Firefox, Safari, Explorer, Chrome).
            It retrieves information from other parts of the web and displays it
            on your device (Eg: Firefox, Safari, Explorer, Chrome).A web page is
            a document that is displayed in a web browser or as an HTML source.
            A web page is also called document or document object. A web page
            can be accessed by entering URL into address bar of Browser. The
            document object deals with everything you see (and don't see) as a
            user- this is where we spent most of our time as users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every HTML element you use has a JS equivalent representation; this
            is object representation. Object representation allows you to access
            and modify html elements in JS. The DOM is a data representation of
            these objects and an application programming interface (API) for web
            documents.
          </p>

          <p>
            The individual aspects of a document object are known as nodes. In
            other words, Node is an interface that makes up the DOM. The DOM
            consists of a hierarchy of nodes. Each node can have a parent and/or
            children. Every node is an object. Every HTML element is a node, but
            not every node an HTML element:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/node-tree.png" alt="Node Tree" />

          <p>
            The DOM can be accessed in different ways. The first method to
            access the DOM is by ccessing tools on the right top corner of the
            page, the clicking 'more tools', and then clicking 'developer
            tools'. The scond way to access the DOM is by using the Control +
            Shift + i keys. The last metod is to simply use the F12 key when you
            are on the page you wish to inspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            A DOM Event is a signal that something (an event) is occurring, or had
            occurred. Can be triggered by user interactions and/or the browser.DOM
            Events can record data, notify users and/or devs of the triggered
            event. Here is an example of a .addEventListener() method:
          </p>

          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Objects are used to represent a 'thing' in your code. The data inside
          objects are known as Properties that consist of a key and a value. The
          keys are iterable and can be accessed in any order. Objects are best
          to use when the elements strings (text).

          <p>
            Arrays store data in an ordered collection in which the data can be
            accessed using a numerical index. The data inside an array is known
            as Elements. Numerical indexes are zero based which means the first
            item is stored at Oth index, second at first and so on, last item is
            stored at n-1th index. Arrays are best to use when the elements are
            numbers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Standard practice is to use and array if you have to store the data
            in order or in a sequence, otherwise you can use object for
            everything else.

        <dd>
          JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. Functions are set
          of instructions that describes actions that need to be taken. We can
          call a function several times so it save coding, this is called code
          reusability. It makes our program compact. We don't need to write many
          lines of code each time to perform a task.

          <p>
            Here is an example of how to define and call a function using the
            traffic light system example from above. In the following image, the
            switch statement is nested within a function:
