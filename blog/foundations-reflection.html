          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I have learnt that:

          <ol>
            <li>
              I struggle to ask for help and my ego is definitely a barrier in
              this journey. I can feel too embarrassed, and proud to ask for
              help.
            </li>
            <li>
              The importance and impact of reflections. Reflecting regularly as
              a part of this course has often lead me to changing and improving
              my approach towards myself, others, and coding challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am more capable than I give myself credit for and practising
              keeping a growth mindset (from core learning) has helped me
              recognise this.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Values, empathy and self-awareness are all critical components of the
          human skills required to thrive as a programmer. These components also
          drive intent and how energy is implemented through the tools a dev
          learns. It's not just about being an effective 'co-worker'. Having
          self-awareness and values that guide ethical software development
          whilst considering the flow on impact of your work is a social
          responsibility that many devs are not aware of. Empathy driven
          development allows devs to take into account accessibility,
          inclusivity, and the social implications of their work.

        <dt>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</dt>
        <dd>
          I was surprised that the core learning really made me confront and
          challenge my fixed thinking around what is possible for me.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</dt>
        <dd>
          It can be hard to be real with yourself as you do this core stuff, and
          this can bring up a pool of emotions during the process.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I think EDA spends time focusing on core skills to not just improve
          the students' chances of employability, but to also get people to
          think about the meaning they give to the tools we learn here. This
          approach to coding encourages students to think outside the box, to be
          innovative, and to drive progressive development of technology (and to
          not just train another 'code monkey').
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I think it was a vital component to entering the world of development.
          Practicing code allows you to learn how to code but not how to apply/
          engage with the skills in a meaningful and ethical manner. This comes
          from within the person themselves. Introspection through core learning
          allows students to think about who they are and what this means for
          their journey as a programmer.
