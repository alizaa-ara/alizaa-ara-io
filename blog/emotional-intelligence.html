        <dt>What is Emotional Intelligence?</dt>
        <dd>
          Your ability to problem solve using social awareness, emotional
          awareness, and emotional regulation. It is a set of vital thinking
          skills that were not recognised by traditional understandings of IQ.

        <dt>How is it different to IQ?</dt>
        <dd>
          IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient while EQ stands for emotional
          Quotient. IQ measurements focus on capturing a person's intellectual
          abilities such as using logic, memory, and processing speed abilities.
          Standardised IQ tests have been developed in order to score a person's
          IQ. IQ tests cannot measure other critical aspects of human
          intelligence such as social intelligence, empathy or creativity. This
          is where EQ comes in!

        <dt>Why is it important?</dt>
        <dd>
          The importance of EQ in capturing a more holistic understanding of
          human intelligence has been raised by researchers strongly in the last
          20 years. Emerging research on EQ has lead to the recent development
          of standardised EQ tests that aim to measure abilities such as
          self-awareness, social skills and motivation. Traditionally IQ scores
          have been linked to job performances and academic standing. However,
          there is ongoing debate as to how accurate this is. Researchers have
          also pointed out factors such as cultural relevance and biases in
          historical IQ testing. EQ scores are liked with job satisfaction, less
          stress, and higher success rates of entering employment. Both IQ and
          EQ are important in promoting wellness and employers are increasingly
          measuring both forms of intelligence when recruiting. Studies
          regarding neuroplasticity have been critical in establishing the
          importance of EQ. Similar to how people can work on improving their
          IQ, they can also work on improving their EQ with targeted practice,
          repetition and commitment.
