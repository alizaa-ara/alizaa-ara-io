          Research Neuroplasticity. Discuss how understanding the principles of
          neuroplasticity benefits people.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can empower people as
          it changes their outlook on what their possibilities are.
          Historically, we thought that the brain is a fixed entity and that
          there is little to no room for improving cognitive abilities. Recent
          studies have indicated otherwise and we are now beginning to
          understand the malleable nature of the brain. This means that our
          beliefs around our cognitive limitations can be challenged as the
          discovery of neuroplasticity has proven that we can change our brains
          chemically and physically.

          <p>Researchers have established 10 Principles of Neuroplasticity:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Use it or lose it. Just like bodily muscles, neural pathways
              degrade if they are not used frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use it and improve it. Training your brain with intent and
              focusing on enhancing specific brain functions via regular
              behavioural practice strengthens neural circuits responsible for
              those functions leading to improving targeted abilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Specificity. Targeted training through cognitive exercises and
              behavioural programmes can change the physical make up of the
              brain and enhance the neural pathways accosiated with the
              training.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repetition matters. Change requires practice and regular training.
              This is critical especially in learning and rehabilitation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Intensity matters. How intensely you train your brain will impact
              the level of change in the targeted brain function, leading to a
              corresponding level of change in the targeted ability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Time matters. You can always make improvements because the brain
              is inherently malleable, however, different forms of change in the
              brain happen at different times during training.
            </li>
            <li>
              Salience matters. How meaningful it is for you to make this
              neurological change will impact the the outcomes. The more it
              means to you, the more motivated you are to achieve the change and
              the more likely you are to achieve it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Age matters. It is easier for younger people to change their brain
              using targeted training. This does not mean that change is
              impossible for older adults, it just means that there may be more
              time, practice, and intensity required for an adult to achieve the
              same outcomes as a young person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transference. Training yourself in one task can also flow onto
              other similar tasks if similar neural functions are involved in
              both tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interference. Brain changes that result in unwanted habits can
              interfere with learning desired habits. This is something to be
              mindful of.

          When I find myself thinking that I am incapable of completing a task,
          or learning something I find difficult, the principles of
          neuroplasticity help me feel hopeful. I find that repetition really
          helps me learn and this is something I will apply to my dev academy
          journey.

        <dt>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</dt>
        <dd>
          Neural plasticity does not happen In a vacuum. It is experience
          dependent, and some experiences are going to make a bigger difference
          than others. It is also important to have rested and slept well in
          order for your brain to be able to undergo intensive targeted traning
          and change. Creative processes such as making art, doodling, or
          engaging in a craft can help increase neuropasticity. Other ways of
          increase your neuroplasticity include travelling, gaming, dancing,
          making music, learning a language, and exercising.

          Research Growth Mindset. Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A fixed mindset refers to the perception that things about you, the
          world, and/or others are static and cannot be changed. A fixed mindset
          endorses non-adaptive ideas such as, "I am bad at math, this is how it
          will always be, and nothing can change that." We may have linked our
          historical understanding about the brain being 'hard-wired' to our
          attitudes towards ourselves and our environment. On the contrary, we
          now know that the brain is capable of change due to the discovery of
          neuroplasticity (as discussed above). A growth mindset compliments
          this new discovery about the brain.

          <p>
            A growth mindset is the internalisation of the idea that
            intelligence, skills, and abilities can be enhanced and that the
            brain is not a static entity. Literature on growth mindsets embraces
            neurodevelopment research findings and encourages further
            development of the brain via training, repetition, and
            determination. Being growth-oriented also means failing, learning
            from failures, and pushing yourself into uncomfortable challenges
            that offer growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            No-one is 100% growth-oriented. We all have things we may be
            fixed-minded about, while being growth oriented towards other
            aspects of our life. It is important to remember that life is a
            journey and, there is no growth if there is no room for improvement!

        <dd>
          Some of the emerging research on neuroplasticity was really
          eye-opening and seeing how it compliments a growth-mindset is
          encouraging.

          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          I will spend 5 min everyday during study writing out growth-oriented
          messages to myself and send them to others as well. This will help me
          keep my inner critic in check and create a new neural pathway that is
          growth-focused, which will be reinforced by my repetitive behaviours.

          Blend with your learning plan and strategies. Reflect and discuss how
          these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and
          strategy.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          These understandings have highlighted to me that feeling challenged
          and struggling are actually good things because it means that I am
          growing. This is a new concept for me. I realise now that I had a
          fixed mindset regarding my learning abilities and I assumed that
          feeling challenged by content means that I am not smart enough to
          understand the content. Moving forward, whenever I struggle to
          understand something, I'll try to shift my thinking about it to "This
          is an opportunity for growth even if I fail" rather than "This is
          beyond me".
