          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

          I was working at a youth mental health respite facility and having a
          conversation with my client's mental health nurse. The nurse reviewed
          the young person's progress and was then handing over information to
          me after their review. This mental health nurse made extremely
          judgmental remarks about the young person and called them things like,
          "stupid", "silly little ****". I could just not say anything about
          this MH nurse's attitude, unprofessionalism, and misconduct and no one
          would have known. Given my values of fairness, transparency, and
          growth in mind, I decided to report this nurse who was senior to me. I
          also would not want my vulnerable young client to be 'supported' by
          this nurse given their growth in mind. I am proud of myself with the
          decision I made when I reflect on this and I would do it again for
          anyone else.

          I have Indian, Turkish and Iranian ancestry. I was born in southern
          India and I moved to Auckland when I was 9. I grew up in diverse areas
          of Auckland and come from a collectivist culture. This exposure has
          given me a range of unique experiences that shaped my values and
          identity.

          My compassion allows me to connect with people and this strength makes
          it easy to collaborate and communicate with people in the course.
          Having growth as a value drives my curiosity and learning throughout
          this course; and I also like to support the growth of other's in this
          journey (especially in bootcamp). My determination is a strength that
          will help dedicate time consistently to my study.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.

          I had a different perspective to that of a previous co-corker
          regarding a team strategy for a rangatahi displaying psychosis
          symptoms. We both came from a place of genuine concern for our
          rangatahi and the differing perspectives on team strategy caused
          tension during a team meeting. We tried to resolve this during the
          team meeting and when we ran out of time, I asked to have a one on one
          conversation with my co-worker in order to resolve the conflict. My
          colleague agreed and so we talked about it privately and came to a
          shared understanding. We then went back to the team and proposed a new
          plan that incorporated aspects of both of our ideas in the team
          strategy and the team was also happy with this proposal. I think that
          this was a very effective strategy and we actually became friends
          outside of work afterwards. If our one on one chat had not worked, I
          would have escalated it to our supervisor and asked for their
          involvement in facilitating an agreement with my co-worker. This would
          provide both of us with guidance and support during the process.
