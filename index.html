      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        In order to stay true to myself and my story, I cannot begin this
        without mentioning my hardships. I come from an underprivelaged
        background where my ancestors experienced cultural displacement,
        religious wars, and trauma for generations. They survived with scars
        that cannot be seen or measured. These scars were passed on to me
        through violence, neglect, and abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking the cycle of generational suffering has come with its own
        challenges. Being born in this reality drives my passion for uplifting
        marginalised communities, equity, and for mental health awareness. I
        studied Gender Studies and Psychology at The University of Auckland and
        worked in the Mental Health space for over 7 years.

        One day, I realised that supporting rangatahi in an industry that was
        not supporting me while I sacrificed my need for a better quality of
        life is also an aspect of that old cycle for me. I decided to pursue
        something that breaks through internalised ideas regarding my
        capabilities while also enhancing my quality of life- Software
        Development!

        Apart from having a never-ending exestential crisis and hating on
        Capitalism, I like to do:
